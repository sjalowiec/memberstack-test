Knitting a proper swatch is the key to success with your knitting machine. Follow along as I knit a swatch and walk you through the entire process.

This is my LK, and I’m knitting stockinette, but the process is the same for all machines and stitch patterns.

No matter how you plan to measure your gauge—using a regular ruler or a gauge ruler—you will be measuring a specific number of stitches and rows within a larger piece. Measuring within a larger piece allows for accurate measurement without distortion from the edges.

### Cast On and Setup

Use the cast-on method of your choice—just get some stitches on the machine.

I pulled every other needle and worked an e-wrap cast-on over every other needle. Next, thread the carriage. Wiggle and pull to confirm that it’s threaded correctly and the yarn will flow smoothly.

When you are sure the carriage is threaded correctly, pull down on the working yarn in the back to take up any slack.

You can hang your cast-on comb now. I knit one row first, then added my cast-on comb and a single weight.

Knit a few rows and end with the carriage on the right.

Remove the working yarn from the carriage, but don’t break or cut it. Just loop it over the edge of the machine.

### Adding Waste Yarn

Thread up a contrasting color of similar weight and wiggle and pull to confirm it is threaded correctly. If not, you run the risk of dropping all the stitches off the machine.

Hang a clothespin or chip clip on the yarn tail to add weight.

Knit two rows with the contrasting yarn. Break that waste yarn and secure it with the clip. Using the clip ensures the end stitches knit well.

Set your row counter to zero.

Re-thread the main yarn in the carriage. Wiggle and pull to make sure it’s inserted correctly. If needed, reach back and pull down to remove any slack.

### Adding Stitch Markers

Knit a few rows and place markers.

Markers are just short pieces of contrasting yarn tied into a slip knot. Knit to the row where you want the marker. The markers will isolate the number of stitches you’ll be measuring.

For example, if you’re measuring stitches, place markers on the left and right needles that define the center stitches.

To place a marker, put the loop of the marker in the hook of the needle. Pull the needle out so the stitch falls behind the latch, then pull the marker through the stitch—manually knitting a stitch with the marker loop.

Do this on both sides.

Continue knitting the number of rows you’ll be measuring.

### Finishing the Measured Section

Remove the main yarn from the feeder, but don’t cut it. Loop it around the end of the machine.

Thread the contrasting yarn again and knit two rows. Remember to wiggle and pull to confirm proper threading.

Knit two marker rows with the waste yarn and break the contrasting color.

Re-thread the main yarn, wiggle and pull, and knit two or three rows.

### Recording Tension with Eyelets

Next, mark your swatch with your carriage tension setting.

I’m using tension 6, so I’ll create six eyelets as a permanent record.

To make an eyelet, use a single-prong transfer tool to remove a stitch and transfer it to its neighbor. This empties the needle. Skip a needle and repeat across for the number of eyelets needed.

Be sure to return all empty needles to working position so you continue knitting normally.

On the LK and some other machines, you may set tension between numbers, such as 6+. In that case, create six eyelets, skip a few needles, and add one additional eyelet.

Establish a code that works for you so you can identify the exact setting months later.

After forming the eyelets, confirm all needles are in working position.

Knit a few more rows.

### Binding Off

Bind off using your preferred method.

I manually knit the last row with fairly large loops. Place the yarn in the hooks of the needles and manually knit each stitch.

To prepare for binding off, carefully pull all the needles all the way out. Pull loop through loop to bind off.

Swatches are a great opportunity to learn and practice different bind-off and cast-on methods.

Use the yarn tail to secure the last stitch.

### Dressing and Measuring the Swatch

With the swatch off the machine and the ends secured, wash and block it using the same method you’ll use for your finished garment. This is called dressing your swatch.

It’s a good time to discover how the yarn behaves.

Do not measure your swatch right off the machine. Let it rest for several hours, then dress it. You may even let it rest again before measuring.

Use a regular ruler or gauge ruler to establish your stitch and row gauge.

Attach a string tag to record your machine, tension, gauge, dressing method, and any other notes.

Knitting a proper swatch is the secret to successful machine knitting.
